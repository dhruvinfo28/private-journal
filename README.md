### About
 



### Key Features
- Personalised Journal With sentiment Analysis: Our web app allows users to express their day by typing their feelings over a digital canvas which in turn attempts to analyse their sentiments using an ML model to give them what they really need.
- Mamta, your friend in need: Our website also includes a trained bot - “Mamta” to help users to feel positive and happy just how everyone feels on the lap of their mother. This bot keeps a user engaged through interactive questions. It recognizes user inputs and replies accordingly.
- Customised Questionnaire: It is also designed in such a way that it analyses the user's psychological state and determines his/her happiness index.
- Personalised feeds: The web app shows customed dynamic content based on the problems user is dealing with. These are highly selected and limited feeds conceptualised on the strong scientific Cognitive Behavioural Therapy(CBT) principles.
- Hapiness Index Plotter: The data collected over a certain period is rendered in the form of a graph and  helps in determining if the person needs psychiatric help, and the analysis can be shared with a doctor.
